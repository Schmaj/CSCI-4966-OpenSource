2. It is important to choose a license in order to clearly state important information about your software. A license will clearly state rules regarding packaging, distribution, and other legal considerations.  By default, software without a license will be considered "all rights reserved." So in order to make it open-source, it must have an open-source license explicitly.

3. Using a project without an explicit license will be considered using someone else's copyrighted property without their permission. This is because without an open-source license, software is considered "all rights reserved" and copyrighted.

4. I agree with this claim.  People are more likely to contribute to a project and improve upon it if it has greater room to grow.  Furthermore, if the project is not as developed, the community may be able to build upon it in a way better than the actual project team. If a project is released early, the community may also be able to add functionality that would be too difficult to add later in the development.

5. GNU/Linux uses the GPLv2 license for their software.  It aligns with the goals and philosophy of the project in that GNU/Linux was developed in order develop a free operating system kernel without the licensing restrictions of other proprietary operating systems.  The Linux project is designed around creating a truly free operating system.  The GPLv2 guarentees this.  According to the license, the users are free to access it, use it, modify it, and share either the original or your modified version. It is also considered a viral license, because any software that includes or modifies the original, will be considered under GPLv2 license.
