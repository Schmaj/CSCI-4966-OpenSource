a. 1. The Open Source Definition is important because it clearly describes what Open Source is and how to make to make software open source, beyond just granting access to the source code.

a. 2. One way to better answer a question in a helpful way is to explain your answer clearly and ensure that there is no ambiguity. Make sure your answer does not confuse the other person further. Another way answer a question well is to make sure you clearly understand the question being posed. Giving an answer to a question not asked is sometimes worse than giving no answer at all.

a. 3. From the third chapter, I have learned a few things.  First, I learned that in 2004, more than 65% of RPI's undergrads graduated in the top 10% of their high school class.  Furthermore, I did not know that RPI was considered "one of America's foremost technological research institutions."  With respect to Jesse Jordan, I learned that unexpected consequences of seemingly good ideas can be extremely severe.  What began as an excellent technological project ended up costing Jordan $12,000.  I also learned that one can be held accountable for what others have done with your software.  Although Jesse Jordan did not directly pirate or even endorse pirating, he was held accountable because he created a service that indirectly led to pirating. One must be extremely conscious of the possible implications of their work, both direct and indirect.
